    <p>Siddhartha wadcs the son of a Brahmin, his father was rich and respected. Siddhartha brought joy to people around him. However, Siddhartha wanted to seek enlightenment, something more than what his family provided for them. He tried ways his religion provided to him but it didn‚Äôt work out despite his efforts, he still was longing for something more.</p>
<p>As he saw that his elderlys did not seek enlightenment, he decided to try a new path.</p>
<p>After a few days, as he gazed out, he saw a group of Samanas begging for food, they had barely clothes.He was interested in their culture as it was quite different from his current way of living.</p>
<p>He begged his father to join the Samanas, his father beauty refused but he was very persistent. His father knew that he could not stop him so he let Siddhartha join the Samanas. He soon learned to let go of his desires, the desires for love, money, everything providing him from entering his peaceful mind.</p>
<p>After a while adapting to the Samanas culture, he realized it was not what he wanted, even the teachers and the elderly Samanas have yet to achieve the enlightenment Siddhartha was longing for. Therefor Govinda led Siddhartha to the buddha. Where the Buddha lived, everyone looked up to him. Govinda was eager to hear more about this holy person people talk upon. After a lesson from the Buddha, Govinda was convinced and eager to become an apprentice of his. But Siddhartha thought that the Buddha wont give him answers he longed for. As he said, the buddha has robbed him, he has robbed him out of his precious friend, but he had gave him more in return.</p>
<p>Siddhartha was sad that Govinda had to leave him, he once thought that Govinda won&rsquo;t walk a step without him, now that he decided on his own route. Siddhartha was truly happy for him.</p>
<p>Siddhartha wandered around for a long time, and here he found a small town.<br>
Siddhartha knew this charming girl named ‚ÄúKamala‚Äù, he just knew that she was perfect for learning about love. But Kamala wanted a man with pockets full of money, Siddhartha only had ripped clothes back then. Kamala convinced him to be a merchant. With Kamala‚Äôs help, he soon was employed by a merchant, ‚ÄúKamaswami‚Äù and began learning about the business world. Kamala became his lover and taught him about love.</p>
<p>Soon, a few years passed, he became a successful merchant and had pockets full of money.</p>
<p>He still thought that he longed for something more. One night, he decided to abandon everything here since he still thought he didn&rsquo;t get what he longed for, instead he considered himself moving farther away from the ‚ÄúEnlightenment‚Äù He longed for.</p>
<p>He wandered around like a drunk man and he soon fell upon a river, he wanted to drown himself but he fell asleep.</p>
<p>While Siddhartha was sleeping on the riverbank. Govinda (Now as a monk) saw a man sleeping beside a river, and was concerned, he didn&rsquo;t recognize Siddhartha at all. But sat beside him protecting him from snakes.</p>
<p>Although Govinda didn&rsquo;t recognize Siddhartha, when Siddhartha woke up, he immediately recognized Govinda. Govinda said that Siddhartha changed quite significantly, he had now the look and attitude as a rich man, nothing compared to the man with no clothes.</p>
<p>Govinda was now a monk, still a apprentice from the Buddha and did not yet seek enlightenment</p>
<p>Siddhartha reached enlightenment at the end with the lessons of the riverman, he finally reached what he wanted for years.</p>
<p>My favorite character is Kamala since shes cute and earnest and the others are just stupid. I think that Siddhartha was selfish by just leaving Kamala behind and only cares about his own ‚ÄúEnlightenment‚Äù. And Gamala doesn‚Äôt even know what he‚Äôs doing, he first followed Siddhartha since he thought he ‚ÄúHad a clue on what he‚Äòs doing‚Äù and then he followed the Buddaha, its like he just follows the nearest person to him that he thinks has a idea on what they are doing.</p>
<p>My least favorite character is Buddaha, since he knows what he&rsquo;s doing, he knows it&rsquo;s wrong but he has a huge crowd of people surrounding him. And he dares not to tell them that they&rsquo;ll never reach enlightenment with his help. Unlike the river guy, the Buddaha is not ‚ÄúComfortable‚Äù In his ‚ÄúEnlightenment‚Äù.</p>
<p>I think that Siddhartha used a rather selfish way to reach his own enlightenment, he first left his father, then he ditched Govinda, and after that, he abandoned Kamala. He only really just caused trouble wherever he went. My sister told me that Herman wrote several books about people reaching enlightenment in their own paths. And Siddhartha went the slightly selfish path.</p>
<p>I was moved by Vasudeva‚Äôs speeches,he foreshadowed the timelessness of the river. Siddhartha soon realized that his life is also like a river. He brought Siddhartha back to Nirvinia.</p>
