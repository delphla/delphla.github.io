    <p>“Gemma, it’s time for bed. Have you brushed your teeth?” Grandma said.</p>
<p>“I did, but Grandma, before I go to bed, can I tell you about something that happened at school?”</p>
<p>“Sure!” Grandma said, sitting on the edge of Gemma’s bed.</p>
<p>“We had a new teacher today. She doesn&rsquo;t know what she’s talking about!” Gemma stuttered angrily. “Today, we discussed The Giver and she hasn’t even read it and knows absolutely nothing about it. When I tried to tell her that her account of events differed from the book, she immediately denied it, yelled at me, and told me not to speak anymore during the class!”</p>
<p>“That doesn’t sound like a good teacher.”</p>
<p>“What can I do Grandma? It’s the worst class.”</p>
<p>Grandma thought for a while before she spoke. “In my day, we had terrible schools too. We had many debates about what were called residential schools. Teachers would try to control the kids in order to make them forget their culture. Many think that, “Oh! Those problems are in the past!&rsquo;&rsquo; However, sadly it’s not the case. It isn’t exactly the same, but racism continues to this day, with indigenous voting booths being farther away than others, or news of an indigenous grandfather being arrested by police for simply trying to open a bank account for his granddaughter with his government issued Indian status card.</p>
<p>“The police shut down the voices of people who spoke up about injustice. It’s ostensibly the job of the police to ensure citizens obey laws that provide safety and fairness. Instead, they are discriminating against those that speak out and in some cases unknowingly perpetuating systemic racism. Nowadays, after the public execution of George Floyd, there has been a similar movement for defunding the police.”</p>
<p>“I’ve heard of George Floyd, and it’s awful what happened to him, but how would defunding the police change anything?” Gemma said curiously.</p>
<p>“Well, defunding the police is a movement that supports taking away funds from the police and instead using it on non-policing forms of public support and safety such as housing, employment, community health, education and much more. To better understand, there is one person in particular that started this movement, Kandace Montgomery.”</p>
<p>“I never heard of Kandace Montgomery?”</p>
<p>“Despite having a disadvantage, she spoke up and potentially opened a new door to a better society. Rightly, she believes the police are asked to solve too many issues that they are not professionally trained for. Instead of police funds going to crimes or prisons which commonly assume that certain races are criminal and perpetuating systemic racism, they can use community social members to do the same thing but possibly with more justice.”</p>
<p>“Then why not just train the police more? If they can’t do their job properly, make them practice more!”</p>
<p>“Do you think it would help if your teacher practiced more and made more detailed lesson plans before class?”</p>
<p>“Of course! If she had bothered to read the book, maybe we would even be able to have a proper discussion in class!”</p>
<p>“Sure, it may improve your individual classroom experience, but these problems will only repeat itself, in other classrooms, for other students, as long as your school’s substitute teacher program doesn’t change. Sometimes, problems aren’t individual, but systematic. Retraining police may solve the problem of individual bigoted police officers, but it wouldn’t change an inequitable and violent system. Canada spends significantly less on social services than police services in its national communities. With all that money invested in prisons and policing, it does not make our society safer but on the contrary, more unjust and dangerous. There have already been many attempts to modify the police system from adding more people of all races in the system to the changes after the George Floyd execution. However, none of them worked. The only way to stop violence committed to communities of colour is to defund, not reform.”</p>
<p>“But Grandma, what does reform have to do with me and my classmates? And what can we do?”</p>
<p>“Well, change can start with advocating.”</p>
<p>“Advo-what?”</p>
<p>“Advocating can start when you spread the message to your classmates, or start supporting petitions online. For example, when I was your age, the school lunches were awfully cold. So we started a small petition for warmer, more nutritious lunches, and we tried to get everyone in our class to sign it. It worked and in the end, since our school was quite small, the school decided to buy a microwave and change the cafeteria menu.”</p>
<p>“Well, the food in our cafeteria is delicious already. I don&rsquo;t have to worry about that! But what does this have to do with defunding the police and dealing with this bad teacher?”</p>
<p>“The process starts with speaking to people, gaining support for your cause, starting petitions, joining protests, and educating those that don’t know. Then, you can try to get support from your community, like other students, parents, and teachers. Once you have a movement and support, take it to the principal. Talking to your friends and other students comes first, and parents and grandparents, too!”</p>
<p>“Okay, get me my phone!”</p>
<p>“No, no, Gemma. Sleep. You need your strength for tomorrow.”</p>
