2. Begin With the End in Mind

People are quite indecisive creatures. The stereotypical girls people speak of spend hours of time choosing a dress. Many people didn’t achieve that they exactly “want” in life because they didn't have a goal in mind. You might ask, “Many people do that, they are simply attempting everything before choosing a specific goal, you shouldn’t set a time limit on choosing important stuff”. That is true but the longer you take, the easier it is for you to get farther away from what you truly want as a goal. By what? Well there are quite a few things, such as, other people’s opinions, jealousy, and too much consideration. 

That's why you should set a clear goal for yourself before you start on anything.

4. Think Win-Win
