My Antonia

  


This story starts in the 1800s.

Jim Burden went aboard a train to Virginia to live with his grandparents. 

Time flew by, he quickly adapted to his new home.

He got a warm home with his loving grandparents, Peter and Parel, his new friends, and Antonia as his student

Jim and Antonia played all day. Together, they discovered new adventure areas, made pastries together while Jim also helped Antonia with her studies. 

With Jim’s help, Antonia has adapted to this new land while her long-lasting friendship with Jim began.

Jim was attracted to the bright personality of Antonia and the light atmosphere from being around her.

  


One thing Jim disliked about Antonia was that Antonia was behaving inferior to him.

Once, the children borrowed a knife from Peter and went on a prairie trip.

When messing around, they were approached by a rattlesnake while Jim and Antonia were so focused that they did not realize.

While the snake was striking, Jim turned around and stabbed the snake.

Antonia bragged about the "Courageous" behavior of and how manly he was while killing the snake.

Antonia never acted inferior to Jim again while Jim got the little respect he wanted.

  


One day, Parel died suddenly. In shock, Peter starts looking for a new job to support the family while Mr. Shimerada is jealous.

Soon they realized they could barely support the family. 

During winter, Jim had a cozy warm holiday with his grandparents while Mr. Shimerada has awful financial issues. 

During January, Jim’s grandparents invited Mr.Shimerada over. 

While witnessing how Jim has been living so comfortably, Mr. Shimerada regretted his decision of moving over here, while he still hasn’t moved on from Peter’s death. And so, he committed suicide. 

The family experienced another family member's death, the whole family has been more distant, including Jim and Antonia.

Around March, Antonia joined her brother with farm work. 

Antonia no longer had time to play with Jim all day long like before, soon they distanced away for the second time.

  


After a few years, Jim’s grandparents and he moved away from Virginia for Jim to have better education. 

While Jim was studying, Antonia was working with a cutter. During their free time, they would go and dance together at clubs.

Jim still had feelings for Antonia however Antonia only had feelings for him as a little brother. 

  


After a few years, Jim and Antonia left each other. 

One day, Jim overheard from Lina that Antonia got married, however, he didn’t visit her until he received a letter from Antonia.

There was one thing that caught Jim’s eye especially, it was the letter signed as, Your old friend, Antonia.

When he visited Antonia at the farm, they both changed so much, they barely recognized each other.

She had hands rough from working at the farm, and quite a few cheerful children but still the cheerful personality that he missed dearly.

Remembering all the moments from their childhood.

  


My favorite character is Antonia, her overall personality seems like a joyful dainty girl. 

Being a girl hiding behind Jim’s back, she slowly grew into an independent woman with her own thoughts and decisions.

After emigrating multiple times, she no longer had anyone to depend on, enduring so much burden and still being the same joyful girl.

In the story, she represents all the memories and love of Jim.

  


I like this book since even though the book didn’t end in the stereotypical happy ending, i still feel like it’s a happy ending for both of them. With jim overcoming his past, and Antonia with her new future.
