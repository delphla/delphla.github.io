Pride and Prejudice 

**  
  
**

The Bennet family had five sisters, all with their own charm.

Mrs. Bennet was eager to see all her daughters married due to the daughters' age and inheritance problems.

After a while, soon the news got spread around of a rich gentleman, Mr. Bingley, arriving with his friend named Mr. Darcy.

Upon the arrival of a  wealthy gentleman named Mr. Bingley, he joined a local ball in the neighborhood.

He spent the whole evening at the ball, dancing, while he took an interest in the eldest daughter of the Bennet family, Jane. 

Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy was not very sociable, he rejected everyone at the ball which made his reputation in the neighborhood awful.

After the ball ended, the family was excited about Mr. Bingley’s interest in Jane.

Jane commented about Mr. Bingley’s charming behavior and amiable personality while Mr. Bingley also liked her back thinking that she was the “Prettiest” among them despite their difference in social status.

After several other social gatherings, Mr. Darcy started to show attraction towards Elizabeth, however, he thought of her as “not fit for a wife”.

After Elizabeth came over to the Netherlands, their relationship got to the point that Mr. Bingley noticed.

A few months passed, just when Elizabeth left Neverland, Elizabeth found out that her best friend got married to Mr. Collins.

Mr. Collins was a foolish guy, not even to mention he just got rejected by Elizabeth a few months ago. Her friend explained that she did not marry Mr. Collin by love, she needed financial support and her parents were rushing her marriage. 

Hearing of her friend’s situation, Elizabeth had a goal to marry by happiness and will.

Jane visited the town to meet friends, but she secretly wished to meet Mr. Bingley.

Meanwhile, Jane got a sudden proposal from Mr. Darcy, which she respectfully rejected.

Soon after, she received another letter from Mr. Darcy, in which he apologized for forbidding her sister's engagement, but he insists that Jane and Mr. Bingley aren't a serious couple.

During Spring, Lydia came back to the Netherlands married to a man named Mr. Wickham.

Jane also got a proposal from Mr. Bingley, Jane was delighted and accepted the proposal.

A relative of Mr. Darcy forbids Elizabeth to accept Darcy’s feelings, Elizabeth said that she does not want to get married to Mr. Darcy, but she wants to marry against her will.

Soon Mr. Darcy proposed to Elizabeth, Elizabeth accepted happily which resulted in a happy ever after.

My favorite character is Elizabeth, for I think she’s a quick-witted girl with also an amiable personality.

She was one who got a happier ending in this story, I guess how she insisted on marrying for love and nothing else paid off.

Elizabeth was also a good sister, she had good relationships with her sisters, she always comforted them when they were sad and talked together all the time.

I think she has self-realization skills which are pretty admirable, she realized her prejudice against him and overcame it.

I like this book since the dialogues and details in this story made the story very interesting and vivid. 

None of the characters was written as the antagonist, though some of them made decisions that were incorrect from a reader’s perspective, instead were fairly from a character’s perspective. 

However, I do think that some characters were written selfishly but still ended in a neverless happy ending.
