Moby Dick 

**  
**

Ishmael, a sailor arrives at New Bedford where he met several friends. One named QueeQueq, with whom he shared a bed. At first, he seemed intimidating but after several encounters, eventually, Ishmael saw the nice side of him.

Together, they went to Nantucket to start a voyage on a ship named Pequord, with a strange captain named Ahab.

Soon after the Pequord took sail, Ahab made his first appearance on the ship, announcing how his leg broke by a whale named Moby Dick and declaring his desire to seek vengeance.

Moby Dick however wasn’t an ordinary whale, barely anyone knows much about him except the fact that he was a legendary white whale.

The sailors soon set on their mission to capture Moby Dick, they captured a few whales, but they caught no sign of Moby Dick. 

Some unlucky phonetics came true too, several misfortunes almost led to death, including a little boy who barely survived after being left behind, also a harpooner almost sank but got rescued by QueeQueq.

One day, a typhoon lit the ship on fire, the crew members luckily survived. Just by a few days, a sailor drowned by falling. 

The crew member’s soon realized the mission they’re going on is practically “suicidal” which led to a rival towards Ahad to return home.

However, Ahad did not listen to the members, but his anger towards the whale started to exaggerate hearing how his friends could not endure with him.

His desire to find the halo exaggerated, his anger continued to rise.

**

After days of hunting, they finally found Moby Dick. They became their intensive attack, with Ahad caught in the harpoon and swirled to death. With Ishmael flung out from the earlier attack, he was the only survivor of this disaster. 

He went aboard another ship, where he continued to search for dead members.

I don’t think there is a certain amiable character in this story, so I guess my least favorite character is Ahad.

Ahad has lost his foot to the whale, which I’m sure that the whale didn’t target him unlike he did. 

He is allowed to get furious as it is an incurable injury. However, he got swirled inside his hate for the whale and pulled an entire crew of people to get swirled in his feelings.

I think this was a selfish behavior, however, despite how he couldn’t be rational during that period.

I like this book for an adventure fiction story, the plot is interesting and the point of the characters was clear. The madness and tribulation were foreshadowing every movement.

And i found online that many of the characters had interpretations. Such as Ahab representing an evil king leading the Israelites into doom; Rachel (the ship that saved Ishmael) was representing the mother of Joseph, known for protecting her children.
