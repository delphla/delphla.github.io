Do Facebook and other forms of social media isolate people from each other?

**  
**

I believe that Social Media is used to maintain already existing relationships and more opportunities to meet new people. Social media is like a classroom but different types of people from different parts of the world are all gathered together. It has already replaced people’s old ways of communicating for example; letters, telephones, etc. About only 20 years ago, you had to pay to communicate with people, but now we can just easily communicate via social media. Now we can accomplish many things online; shopping, education, bonding relationships. 

I’m pretty shy in real life,  I just happen to be more outgoing online? My friend once said that I’m different online. She even wrote in my birthday card that I never filter my weird jokes. I made a lot more friends online than I did in real life. Back in second grade or something, I remember people giving me the “Talented Kid” Title and ignoring me. Saying it's not safe for me to play this game since I'm “small”. (what is it like online? How is it different?)I think it's easier to make friends online due to being more “Social” and you can configure yourself to be the “Better self”. 

On the internet, you can lose nothing (Except for your reputation online of course), it allows people to express their own opinion more, and meet more people that support your opinion. Nothing will happen even if you offend someone. Of course, this makes social media more toxic. As human beings yearn for support and belonging. But social media is overall ok for me? Since I'm in a game/art community, just make sure you stay in a positive community if you're on social media. I think social media makes people more open to others too. Even a few studies have linked that social support leads to positive mental health. (([Studies info:](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/mental-health/social-media-and-mental-health.htm))

Although Social Media has a lot of good things there is stuff quite disturbing and toxic on there. Lots of people are controversial and start arguments for no reason, the accounts with big followings always get the advantage. You either need to be a prodigy at something or do a lot of giveaways to get a large following count. And I find the accounts with big followings tend to isolate from their previous “Friends” after they grow. 

And a lot of people are very toxic, if you're a big account, you get canceled if you post a little thing wrong.

Therefore, Social Media is easy to cause conflicts against people/your friends.

Social media also causes people to be less interactive IRL, you often set yourself higher online than in real life. And that could disappoint people if they ever meet you in real life. 

But those cases are very rare as you just have to stick in the positive communities. 

Therefore I believe that Social Media does not isolate people from each other but an opportunity to make new friends and bond your relationships with current ones.
