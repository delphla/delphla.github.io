****

  


Once upon a time, there was a peaceful little wood in the depths of a boisterous city. The woods weren’t like the city at all. It was a lovely wood with evergreen trees all over and a pond which shimmered when the sun illuminated the water. Fishes joyfully splashing water and paradise birds chirping joyfully in those branches. Wind passes by causing willows to blow elegantly. And in the middle of this wood, there was a little red cabin. Even though it’s petite, it's quite dainty. Th\,,e windows were elegantly covered without even a dash of dust. The door was made out of wood, with some panels carved with caution. The chimney always had freshly made bread rising out of it. In that dainty little cabin, lived a joyful family, two boys and a mother and a father. Quite a normal family to be honest. The elder brother, Noah, was almost an adult. And the younger brother, Liam, was only a teenager. The start was fine, it was just like a normal family though a bit lonely because the father was often on trips due to the little amount of jobs in the woods. And the mother was busy due to the household. Liam was always quite lonely and life was quite dull. But Noah was always there to accompany him and support him, not minding the age gap. But when time passed, Noah grew into an adult, and he soon left the little cabin to develop his own little family in the city due to better circumstances and passion for getting a well-paid job. But Liam was heartbroken when his elder brother left. He soon became all gloomy, his family didn’t know what to do. They gave him a better room, made him go to school, but it didn’t seem to get better.

  


Until one day, while his father was hunting for food since it was hunting season. He found a little pup wandering in the woods. It didn’t seem like it was from the woods, more like it wandered away from the city due to it being a little pug, and it had a glimmering little collar even though it was covered with dust and ashes. It looked helplessly at the father, and the father couldn’t stand the guilt of not bringing a little lost pup to a welcoming home. So the father flipped through his messy backpack, finally finding a rough braided string, and used it as a leash to bring the dog home.

  


The dog ran around, sniffing everything it saw. It wasn’t quite obedient either, for it lived in the wild. It attacked everything that wiggled. In his perspective, everything was a deadly beast, probably due to the terrifying wildness in the woods, even though it was an elegant little wood. There was a part far away from it, it was quite the contrary to this wood. It was full of withered trees, blood traces leaked from the pond. Miserable shrieks echoed down the woods, every little animal at the bottom of the animal cycle was erased. And it was even more terrifying since it was hunting season. The stars were almost covered by the trees, multiple flashing eyes seem to be coming out of the trees. Guns reloading and shooting, stampede hooves pounding on the ground. It was a miracle that this little pug pup was still alive. 

  


At the cabin, it was terrified, yelping, cuddled up in a little corner. The parents tried to approach the scared pug, concluding with the pug slamming the door and hiding in the closet. Liam, at that time, was doodling behind the clothes in the closet. The pug was awfully afraid of Liam and tried to act aggressive. Liam giggled at the pug and the pug was no longer afraid. The pug became Liam’s best friend; he helped him overcome his fear, his shadows and his loneliness. And Liam helped the pug get over his shadows and aggressiveness. For them it was a win-win, but not for long. The pug rams his head into the couch cushions and launches his butt into the air, snuffling and growling excitedly.He achieves a partial headstand and his hind legs kick wildly. He is the embodiment of joy, and that joy is infectious. 

  


They played together every single day, the sun illuminating them. The trees were almost dancing and the animals seemed to be having fun. The world seemed to be smiling down at them. But as they say: “Time is a  river. Happy those who allow themselves to be carried, unresisting, with the current. They float through easy days. They live, unquestioning, in the moment.” 

  


(I don’t want the dog to die anymore, it’s too tragic xD)
