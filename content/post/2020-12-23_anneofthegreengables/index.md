anne of the green gables

  


Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert are siblings who live in Green Gables, Prince Edward Island. To help Matthew, who is getting too old to do the farm work on his own, they plan to adopt an orphan boy. At the train station, instead of a boy to do the farm work, the orphanage sent Anne Shirley.

During the ride back home, Matthew found that Anne’s wild imagination and talkativeness enjoys him. 

When Marilla tucked Anne to bed, she told her to tell her prayers, and since she was not familiar she said an awfully ridiculous prayer. That was not it for her ridiculous actions, she wore a fancy flower wreath to church and more childish cute events.

Despite multiple complaints from Marilla about Anne, Anne managed to stay.

Anne tried to behave as Marilla wanted, she was a cheerful and enthusiastic girl with plenty of imagination, but she lacks social manners and exquisite skills. 

Anne never had friends back in the orphanage, she had to bear with her imaginative friends. She longed for friends for a long time, and thankfully she met Diana., her bosom friend. 

Anna was extremely exuberant for a new friend. Although she was bothered by the thought of Diana’s mother not approving of her poor “Lady manners”.

One day, Anne invited Diana to a little tea party, instead of giving Diana her typical raspberry cordial., she gave Diana wine.

Eventually, when Diana’s mother found out that Diana was drunk, she thought that Anne did it on purpose and forbidden Diana from hanging out with Anne.

While Anne went to school , she met a boy named Gilbart. Anne despised him from the start since he made fun of her “carrot” hair. 

She was excellent at her studies, as she devoted quite a lot in them. With her devotement, she manages to get a scholarship and attend four years of college for free which was quite her dream.

To share her accomplishment, Anne hurried back to Green Gables, where she heard that Matthew died out of a heart attack and Marilla is likely to go blind.

She acknowledges that Marilla needs someone to take care of herself. She decides to give up her chance to go to college and stayed at green gables.

Hearing the news, Gilbart gave up his work of being a teacher at a school near green gables as Anne would be closer to Marilla.

Anne’s rivary with Gilbart has ceased, she understands where to put her devoteness but still was optimistic as before.
