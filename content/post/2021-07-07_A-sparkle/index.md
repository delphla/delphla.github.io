A sparkle

  


  


The Covid lockdown has taken from us and has made us miss significant parts of our lives. Ultimately, we miss our friends and family most, and I am no different.

  


My teacher and classmates, their humor, the sound of chalk scraping against the blackboards, the chatter that almost never stops, these are the moments I miss. On rainy days, my friends and I would run through the heavy rain; hiding under a single rain jacket. On sunny days, we would sunbathe together, rolling down the grassy hills. I remember one such sunny day. We had to run a lap test. Lap tests are short races where the teacher records the time we take to run around the school. I’m not a fast runner--I grow tired very easily. When I run too much, my stomach aches. You can imagine I’m not a huge fan of lap tests.

Ayma, my best friend at school isn’t tall but all the strongest boys are scared of her. I witnessed her win a race against the fastest boy in our class!

Before we started, Ayma turned to me, her eyes sparkling. She held my hand in hers and promised that she would run with me, whispering, “Bring me chocolate tomorrow.”

I laughed and nodded along as her eyes caught the light from the sun, and I felt its warmth between us.

We all started together. I ran as fast as I could while Ayma jogged easily beside me. I sped up, staying with the others, not wanting to drag Ayma down. I sped up, and she was still by my side, laughing--her eyes sparkling. 

For a moment, it felt as if the world was only the two of us. We made jokes, laughing all of our worries away. Even the soft wind tickled, making me laugh even harder.

I completely forgot about the teacher who was timing us. 

But my stomach began to ache. Soon I began to slow down. I shut my eyes in pain, but Ayma was still by my side. The entire time, I thought I could never ever have a better friend.

I haven’t seen Ayma for about a year now. The last time was over half a year ago. I learned that eyes don’t sparkle as much through a glass screen, or maybe it is running with a best friend that makes eyes brighter. I miss the moments and the sparkles and sounds of spending time together; even when feeling pain I still miss seeing and hearing my best friend. 

In the Spring, the cherry blossoms bloomed and my sister Alice and I walked outside. We smelled the fresh air in the streets near our home. Heart-like petals flew off the trees and fluffy squirrels hopped everywhere, running and laughing.

I laughed and thought of Ayma. I began to run ahead of Alice, but I realized I only heard my footsteps. I turned around, wondering what was going on, and she was barely moving! 

She was drifting through the petals around her and only pausing to look at her phone. She started walking a few steps forward, then she stopped again. 

“Come on!” I shouted. 

Alice didn’t understand what was going on but she followed me. The sun was burning that day and I ran and she caught up. 

Although we have lived for years beside the same shops, it felt like I hadn’t been in this neighbourhood before. The details had changed. Shops had closed, others had new signs of Covid, and the people were unidentifiable under their masks. I hadn’t walked on the sidewalk for a long time, and I had forgotten the feel, but I would never forget the smell of bread from inside the bakeries, and was thankful some of the stores that hadn't changed in years were the same.

I craved ice cream, but in the end, the ice cream ended up dripping all over my new shirt, and I was shocked how fast time flew. It was the most fun I’d had during the long quarantine.

  


Although, lives have changed: people might have not seen their families for a long time, some people might be facing economic problems, and some might have lost their loved ones. Despite not knowing what might happen in the future, I believe that we should all have hope that we will reunite again, and the sparkles and sounds and feelings that we have been missing will come back from behind the glass, like people in our lives.
