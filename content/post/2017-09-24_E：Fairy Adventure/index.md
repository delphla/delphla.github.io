Hello, My name is Rose. I want be a flower fairy one day when I wake up. I wanted to go and pick flower. So I ate my breakfast fast and went to pick flower. When I picked flower I saw a flower that was lighting up. I picked it and suddenly I was in a magical garden. I first peeled a little bit of flower and I heard a ticking voice. That said “why are you peel me” and a fairy flow out and the fairy called Merry.

Merry wisper to Winter, another fairy who is Merry’s sister “Rose is a people,”

“Well,” Winter said with a wave of her wands ”

Then Rose turn into a fairy.

“Yeah! Now I am a fairy, I’m so happy,” says Rose

“Do you want to go to Noth Pole?” Winter asked,

“Of course I want”, Rose said ,”I never been to Noth Pole .”

Then in a blink of an eye,they are in Noth Pole .

“ so cold,” said Rose,

“No worry,” Winter said, “I didn’t forget about jacket.”

They start walking. Suddely they saw Santa Clause. They made snow angel, snowman, and snow ball fight together and they have a lot of fun!

“Ｉneed to go back home.” Rose said when they are tired.

“Do you need a lift back home?” Santa Clause asked

“yes.”

Then in a blink of eye, Rose ,Winter and Santa Clause drank hot chocolate back at Rose’s home.

It is a brillian day!
