One day, the little penguin, Mimi, went to a tower. She was curious and opened the tower door. Mimi went inside,” Woo, Woo!!” It was full of treasures and jewellerys!

## Chapter 3  Mimi had a magical necklace and bracelet

When Mimi came back, the door was stuck then she began to cry and her necklace began to glow. She was surprised a princess penguin appeared to help her,”What is wrong?”

Mimi answered,” I’m stuck.”

The princess said,”There are only one way out here is the chimney ”

The little penguin Mimi asked, ”How to get up there ? ”

“You have a magic bracelet, remember?” the princess said and then disappeared.

So the little penguin used her bracelet and let a unicone out of his bracelet.
